## Basic info :

- Unique command filters the output (from either a file or stdin) to remove any duplicates. Thus we get all unique lines and shorter output to focus on. This command greatly reduces stress on searching through file with repeated line outputs. 
- There is one catch though, uniq command, ONLY, identifies the duplicate lines, if they are adjacent to each other. So you know why do we need a command to ```sort``` lines first.
